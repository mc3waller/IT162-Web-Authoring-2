                <p>The emergence and growth of new, various technologies have brought about a variety of ways that people have access to - and experience - the web, media, and information. With that, development for the web has also seen much evolution with the advent of new techniques to build and deliver these experiences. Responsible websites and mobile applications are two of the most common and prevalent mediums through which providing services over the web is possible. But what are they exactly? What is the difference? And is one better than the other?</p>

                <h3>What Are They?</h3>

                <p>A responsive website is a website built with a design capable of automatically readjusting based on varying screen sizes and viewports. The result is a website that can function and be browsed perfectly across any device.</p>

                <p>A mobile application is a type of software designed to run on a mobile device that provides a similar service and experience to that of integrated software systems typically found on desktop computers. Although limited in multi-functionality, usually due to limited hardware resources, their purpose is more focused and offers a better, more personalized user experience, and allows consumers to handpick exactly what functions they desire for their device.</p>

                <h3>Why Are They Important?</h3>

                <p>Before there were mobile devices, desktop computers were the only means of accessing a website. With that, there was also little-to-no variety between the screen and display sizes among computers. At the time, websites could be built just to accommodate the most common display(s). Now, with a wider variety of display sizes across many different devices, the importance of being able to view websites correctly and practically across these variations has become more important and possible with responsive web design. The importance also lies not only with display size, but functionality, as different devices may carry features such as touch navigation, dialing, and GPS applications, and these functions need to be appropriately accommodated as well.</p>

                <p>The key importance of mobile applications lies in the personalized user experience: their ability to perform and provide necessary features for the consumer and meet their needs based on the purpose of the application. This consists of all sorts of functions, ranging from everyday tasks and activities to business and professional needs. Having mobile access to shopping and bank accounts, emails and messages, weather and commuting information, advanced device features, entertainment, or even the ability to work on the go have become increasingly relevant in today’s world. More importantly, businesses and like-minded developers can provide such services through mobile apps which are capable of functioning locally from the devices without the use of a browser.</p>

                <h3>The Difference?</h3>

                <p>Although capable of accomplishing similar things, there are some key differences between the two. The purpose of responsive web design is to make a website flexible across various screen sizes, but responsive mobile design, in particular, refers to the site being specifically designed for mobile use. In that, some certain features (and, more prominently, visuals) are likely adjusted (and possibly removed) from a version suited for a large display to adapt to and accommodate the smaller screen size and particular mobile device functionality. Mobile apps are specific applications that are tailored to each operating system and, as a result, feature unique designs and codebases, as well as certain functionality depending on the installed platform. They may or may not feature some of the same components that could be found throughout their website counterparts.</p>

                <h3>Which is better?</h3>

                <p>From a development perspective, the preference between building a responsive website or a mobile application is more of a personal and situational matter than a general one. Developing a responsive website saves time and money compared to building native software from the ground up, but at the cost of speed and functionality, as navigating a mobile site via the phone’s browser can be slow or inconvenient. On the other hand, mobile applications offer more speed by providing only necessary elements, more functionality due to their customized nature and integration with other device features, and can support brand awareness. However, the amount of time, work, and money typically put into mobile app development can be common setbacks, especially if the final product is poorly executed. Overall, the time-frame, budget, and resources required for one method can have just as much of an impact as the intended necessary features and functionality provided by the other and ultimately rests on the business needs and the purpose of the product itself.</p>
