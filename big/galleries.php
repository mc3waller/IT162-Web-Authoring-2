                <p>In web design, image galleries refer to content sections on a website that allow the user to dynamically browse and view collections of images within a single space on the page. Typically, their purpose is to deliver a series of visual content in one place, but, from a developer’s perspective, they also serve as a great way of presenting additional visuals and other design concepts to the user without being an integrated part of the site’s overall design itself. They are also a great, simple form of interaction that users can have with the website, which is typically achieved by clicking dynamically through a collection of thumbnails or navigating with the use of a slider.</p>

                <p> The most notable language used for scripting galleries is JavaScript (or its simplified jQuery library), but the use of JavaScript versus plain CSS depends on the level of animation and interactivity desired. While these features can be coded by hand simply with CSS alone or in combination with scripting languages that are capable of generating dynamic functionality on a webpage, it is not uncommon for developers to embed code for existing galleries and sliders into their pages. Many content management systems also provide their own gallery extensions, requiring little to no coding experience to use.</p>

                <p>Galleries may also be built and appear differently depending on the device on which it’s displayed. For mobile sites, a gallery may have a more simplistic or touch-friendly design for convenience or the feature of drag-based scrolling. They might also exclude much of the heavy-processing features (such as animations) that may be impractical on many smaller devices.</p>
                
                <p>Some notable styles of animating navigation include smaller (or even uniquely shaped) thumbnails that increase in size when hovered over or selected, flipping images that reveal additional information when interacted with, scrollable rows and columns that contain a large number of items, or the common slideshow style that navigates through images with clickable arrows on either side.</p>
