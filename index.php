                <p>Oh, hello! Didn't see you there - and unfortunately at this rate, I probably never will! So, what better way to identify and introduce myself than with a small wall of text describing vaguely who I am and why I'm here?
                <br><br>
                Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, I've spent most of my adult life working retail and entertainment jobs and became in urgent need of a career change; however, the entertainment work I did, consisting of singing and DJing, were as close to a dream job as I've ever gotten so far. Aside from that, I play more video games than what's probably best for me, but I justify this by constantly learning from them to aid me in creating my own. I also enjoy drawing, building models, mediocre cooking, and I currently live on Capitol Hill with my fianc√©e of almost five years.

                Having started the journy for my programming certificate in the summer of 2019, I'm currently on my last quarter and can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel! It began as an attempt to get my foot in the door of the tech world in hopes of taking up professional game design and development, but having picked up so many new and unexpected skills along the way, I've taken an interest in software and front-end web development as well. We'll see what the future holds, because at this point my priorities are kind of all over the place.
